# Masked Vision Transformer for Predicting Macrovascular Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Graph-based Association Analysis of Attention

This repository provides the implementation of a Masked Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for predicting macrovascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We further propose a graph-based analysis method to interpret the spatial association of attention.
