# Masked Vision Transformer for Predicting Macrovascular Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Graph-based Association Analysis of Attention

This repository provides the implementation of a Masked Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for predicting macrovascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We further propose a graph-based analysis method to interpret the spatial association of attention.

- Dataset: [TCIA HCC-TACE-Seg]([https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/HCC-TACE-Seg](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/hcc-tace-seg/))
  - 105 patinets with HCC
- Baseline Model: [ViT (Timm)](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/models/vision_transformer.py)
  - Package: Based on Timm package (version 1.0.12) made by Mr. Ross Wightman.
